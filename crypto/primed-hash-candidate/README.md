### prompt
After the rather embarrassing first attempt at securing our login, our student intern has drastically improved our security by adding more parameters. Good luck getting in now!

**attachments**: `server.py`
### original specification
Similar to the first one, provide the source to the hash function but have it use several secret values that requires a large number (>1000) data samples to calculate, so automation is required to derive the secret value and determine the hash.

**flag**: `sdctf{W0W_s3cur1ty_d1d_dRaStIcAlLy_1mpr0v3}`
