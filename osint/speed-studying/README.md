### prompt
Help, I'm studying for a test, and I need you to find an example problem for me... I'm sure you can find it out there somewhere! I'm trying to remember this professor's name but I'm having trouble...who is the only professor at UC San Diego that is both an Assistant Professor for the Computer Science department, and an Associate Professor for the Mathematics department?

**Note**:
The flag is not in the usual sdctf{} format. Submit that professor's First and Last name (but not the middle name, if any) separated by a single space. For example, if the professor has first name John and last name Appleseed, submit John Appleseed

### original specification
player will have to pull up the list of professors for both departments and compare them. The correct answer is Daniel Kane.

**flag**: `Daniel Kane`

### prompt
Nice, now that you've found Daniel Kane, I need an example from one of his classes. I don't remember anything about it other than its called "The Skyline Problem". Can you find it?

### original specification
Daniel Kane has snuck a flag into a homework problem called The Skyline Problem. Using a naive search like https://www.google.com/search?q=daniel+kane+The+Skyline+Problem one won't pull up the file, but taking advantage of advanced Google features like https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fcseweb.ucsd.edu%2F~dakane%2F+The+Skyline+Problem will.
