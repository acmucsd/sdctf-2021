A bowl of spaghetti is nice. What about a bowl of pythons?

### original specification
(NOTE: renamed from Python Sanity Check since this is not really as simple as a sanity check) A simple Python script reversing challenge with simple XOR. Nothing more than identifier obfuscation.

The name is a reference to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code, or obfuscated code.
