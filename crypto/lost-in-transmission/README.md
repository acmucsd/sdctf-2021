### prompt
I had my friend send me the flag, but it seems a bit...off.

**attachments**: `flag.dat`
### original specification
The message is literally one bit shift off. Doesn't look like anything under a hexviewer as a result. Use CyberChef to shift it back. The flag is sdctf{W0nD3rfUL_mY_G00d_s1R}

**flag**: `sdctf{W0nD3rfUL_mY_G00d_s1R}`
